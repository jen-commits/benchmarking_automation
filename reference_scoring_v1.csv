High NPS (Promoters): Customers with plans offering higher data limits (e.g., 50GB) and premium features like 5G support generally report higher NPS. Promoters often cite satisfaction with both plan value and network quality.
Low NPS (Detractors): Those on basic or limited data plans express frustration over insufficient data or lack of premium features. These customers are more likely to switch or seek alternative providers due to unmet data needs.
Age Cohort:

High NPS: Younger segments (such as 25–34) tend to be promoters, especially those using data-intensive services, as they value seamless connectivity and data flexibility.
Low NPS: Older age cohorts (e.g., 55+) are more likely to be detractors, often citing dissatisfaction with unclear billing or technical support. This group may prefer straightforward, reliable service over high-tech features, which aren’t always prioritized in their feedback.
Device and SIM Type (eSIM vs. Physical SIM):

High NPS: Tech-savvy users with eSIM setups, often younger or more urban customers, report higher NPS, likely appreciating the convenience and modern features associated with eSIM.
Low NPS: Customers using physical SIMs sometimes face issues with SIM activation or network consistency, leading to lower satisfaction levels. This group may be less engaged with the provider’s digital features and support channels.
